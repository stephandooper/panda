TODO
1. QWK metric
2. QWK loss (this can apparantly be done, but I am no fan of this).
3. Create a more general and flexible input pipeline, that decodes from any .tiff levels to general concat tile pooling sizes on the fly.
4. Clean up repo
5. Incorporate tensorboard and save weights routine
6. Proper references in docs
